# Exploring Bioinformatics Databases with Biopython
Welcome to my Access-Bioinformatics-Databases-with-Biopython repository! I've created this repository as part of my journey through a guided project on Coursera. Throughout this project, I've been immersed in the world of accessing, parsing, and visualizing data using Biopython. I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of bioinformatics sequence and structural online databases, including:
1. ENTREZ
2. PDB
3. KEGG
4. NCBI

I've also delved into the intricacies of interacting with different bioinformatics file formats, such as FASTA, PDB, GENBANK, and XML. I've familiarized myself with a range of parsers, allowing me to confidently read and manipulate these files using the capabilities of Biopython.

In the field of bioinformatics, a common challenge is extracting information from biological databases. Manual database access can be time-consuming, especially when faced with repetitive tasks. Fortunately, Biopython comes to the rescue by providing a way to access certain online databases through Python scripts.

At present, Biopython offers modules specifically designed for extracting information from key databases like NCBI, ENTREZ, PDB, and KEGG. These modules simplify the process of crafting Python code to interact with CGI scripts on the respective database pages. The output is conveniently formatted, and in some cases, seamlessly integrates with Biopython parsers, making information extraction even more efficient.

As I've progressed through this project, I've gained the skills to confidently access, parse, and visualize data from diverse bioinformatics sequence and structural online databases, including ENTREZ, PDB, KEGG, and NCBI, all using the power of Biopython. I've also become adept at working with various bioinformatics file formats, like FASTA, PDB, GENBANK, and XML. This newfound expertise empowers me to employ different parsers to read and refine these files, all within the Biopython framework.
